## 📌 Project Overview

The **Car Price Prediction Web Application** is a Machine Learning powered web platform that estimates the market value of used cars based on multiple input features such as:

- Car Brand
- Manufacturing Year
- Kilometers Driven
- Fuel Type
- Seller Type
- Transmission Type
- Owner History
- Mileage
- Engine Capacity
- Maximum Power
- Number of Seats

The model predicts the estimated resale value instantly through an interactive web interface built using **Streamlit**.
